# stm32f3_srf02_i2c_crude_driver
I2C driver for the SRF02 sensor written for STM32 microcontroller STM32F303VCT6
The first project as I am learning the core of the 32 bit microcontroller. 
The srf02 is a ultrasonic range sensor that can communicate both through I2C and SPI. In this case I am using I2C.
Eventually it is going to became a off-board collision prevension system for UAV
